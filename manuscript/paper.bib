	abstract = {Blue carbon (BC) research has progressed over the years and is continuously evolving. Several existing review papers are available and scrutinized BC research, yet, knowledge gaps and overlaps in science and practice remain a challenge. Thus, we conducted a literature review on 1179 BC-related documents including peer-reviewed articles, technical reports/policy briefs, books/book chapters, conference presentation abstracts, dissertations/theses, and news articles. The work undertaken was guided by three research objectives – (1) to identify the knowledge gaps, trends, and updates in BC literature, (2) to determine the geographic distribution of BC research, and (3) to review the timeline of BC research and elucidate critical issues that potentially drag BC advancement. Key results showed, that, firstly, BC literature favors academic research papers over gray literature (e.g., guidelines, policy briefs). This is critical since research papers are hard to access and process by non-technical persons and practitioners worldwide, thus, promoting gray publications particularly those dedicated to policymakers and coastal managers such as policy briefs and technical manuals are highly encouraged. Secondly, there is an uneven geographic distribution of BC documents, roughly reflecting weak international collaborations among scholars from developing and developed countries. Additionally, this can be attributed to scholar's limited capabilities and international networks. Lastly, BC research remained in favor of natural/physical/applied sciences in comparison to social and policy-oriented papers. Despite this, we noted that the number of social-driven publications in the last two years is increasing, which can change trends in the future. The findings of this review, covering the last 12 years of BC research, can be instrumental to coastal managers and/or practitioners in terms of developing state of the art BC management strategies that are science-based. Moreover, the results can support scholars by complementing their future research agendas to avoid unnecessary overlaps and/or redundancies that can potentially drag the advancement of BC science.},

	abstract = {The protection of organic carbon stored in forests is considered as an important method for mitigating climate change. Like terrestrial ecosystems, coastal ecosystems store large amounts of carbon, and there are initiatives to protect these 'blue carbon' stores. Organic carbon stocks in tidal salt marshes and mangroves have been estimated, but uncertainties in the stores of seagrass meadows-some of the most productive ecosystems on Earth-hinder the application of marine carbon conservation schemes. Here, we compile published and unpublished measurements of the organic carbon content of living seagrass biomass and underlying soils in 946 distinct seagrass meadows across the globe. Using only data from sites for which full inventories exist, we estimate that, globally, seagrass ecosystems could store as much as 19.9 Pg organic carbon; according to a more conservative approach, in which we incorporate more data from surface soils and depth-dependent declines in soil carbon stocks, we estimate that the seagrass carbon pool lies between 4.2 and 8.4 Pg carbon. We estimate that present rates of seagrass loss could result in the release of up to 299 Tg carbon per year, assuming that all of the organic carbon in seagrass biomass and the top metre of soils is remineralized.},

	abstract = {Tidal marshes store large amounts of organic carbon in their soils. Field data quantifying soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks provide an important resource for researchers, natural resource managers, and policy-makers working towards the protection, restoration, and valuation of these ecosystems. We collated a global dataset of tidal marsh soil organic carbon (MarSOC) from 99 studies that includes location, soil depth, site name, dry bulk density, SOC, and/or soil organic matter (SOM). The MarSOC dataset includes 17,454 data points from 2,329 unique locations, and 29 countries. We generated a general transfer function for the conversion of SOM to SOC. Using this data we estimated a median (± median absolute deviation) value of 79.2 ± 38.1 Mg SOC ha−1 in the top 30 cm and 231 ± 134 Mg SOC ha−1 in the top 1 m of tidal marsh soils globally. This data can serve as a basis for future work, and may contribute to incorporation of tidal marsh ecosystems into climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and policies.},
